Blacksmithing may appear as a gargantuan task that takes years to master, but nothing can be mastered without trying. The "How Do I Get Started in Blacksmithing" article on AnvilFire says "you can read until you run out of things to read, but the metal will not move until you hit it with a hammer. The first secret to blacksmithing is simple: get it hot, hit it hard, and quit when you're finished." ("Lessons in Blacksmithing" par. 5) However, knowing some basic technique is necessary.

Dozens of techniques form the functional, yet basic, building blocks of blacksmithing. The most important of these is understanding heat colors, drawing out, and upsetting.

What color metal turns while heated is a crucial indicator for the success of a project. The heat colors, as this is called, can determine what can be done to the metal. DeLaRonde, author of _Blacksmithing: Basics for the Homestead_ says, "as the metal heads up, you will notice a chance in colors from a dull red to a bright red to orange red to yellow red to yellow and finally to white heat" (DeLaRonde 39). If the metal is allowed to become too hot, the metal may burn, rendering it useless.

Drawing out is used to make a rod skinnier and longer. "Drawing out is one of the simplest of the basic techniques, but it is used time and again from the basic projects to the complex" (DeLaRonde 37). It is done by hammering the iron rod out, pushing the hot iron out from under the hammer. Drawing out may be used to create a sharper point, or to make a piece of metal skinnier.

Contrary to drawing out, "Upsetting is compressing a section of a bar to increase its mass in a specific area" ("Fundamentals of Blacksmithing: Upsetting" par. 1). Upsetting requires the iron to be extremely hot, second only to forge welding. Upsetting is often used to create balls or rounded ends to rods ("Techniques and Projects" par. 5).

While these are not the only techniques used in blacksmithing, they are a few of the basics required for any metal work, and these basic skills will create a solid foundation required for the craft of a beginning metallurgist.
