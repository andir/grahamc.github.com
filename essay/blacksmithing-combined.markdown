Blacksmithing has long been looked upon by outsiders as a colossal undertaking, requiring great skill, strength, and knowledge to accomplish. While it is true that the equipment is heavy and the work is hot, nothing can be mastered without trying. The "How Do I Get Started in Blacksmithing" article on AnvilFire says "you can read until you run out of things to read, but the metal will not move until you hit it with a hammer" and "the first secret to blacksmithing is simple: get it hot, hit it hard, and quit when you're finished" ("Lessons in Blacksmithing", par. 5).

When asked what the most important tools for blacksmithing are, Mr. Mike Hammonds responded with "The anvil (about 85 pounds) and the hammer." (Hammonds) As said in Blacksmithing Basics for the Homestead, "If the forge is the heart of any shop, the anvil and the hammers are the brain, because it is with these that the actual forming and shaping is done." (DeLaRonde 19)

The anvil itself is a critical component in the manipulation process. It offers several facets that are all useful in forging iron. The anvil is important as a solid surface to work on. The shape of the anvil, with a horn, a waste, a table, the hardened face, hard- and pritchet-hole are all utilized in various techniques (McRaven 22).

In order to carefully form and shape metal, hammers of varying styles and weights are used. Three basic styles are available for hammers: the cross-peen (most common), the straight-peen, and the ball-peen, and should weigh around three pounds. Heavier hammers are not necessarily any better than a lighter hammer, and can actually be even less effective if accuracy and control cannot be reliably achieved (DeLaRonde 21).

The forge is simply a contained fireplace, with an air-blast channel (McRaven 13). Forges can range in complexity, some literally made form junk parts, to having all the figurative bells-and-whistles possible. Forges can be fueled by multiple sources, including charcoal, bituminous coal, oil, and gas (Dempsy 34).

A good, solid blacksmith's leg vise, as Mr. Jock Dempsy says, is "almost as important as the anvil, and the most used tool in any shop" and should be as large as possible. In lieu of blacksmith's leg vice, a heavy machinist vice over a hundred pounds will do fine. However anything smaller will be destroyed (Dempsy 35).

When these tools are combined with the dozens of basic techniques, they form the functional building blocks of blacksmithing. The most important of these is understanding heat colors, drawing out, and upsetting.

What color metal turns while heated is a crucial indicator for the success of a project. The heat colors, as this is called, can determine what can be done to the metal. DeLaRonde, author of _Blacksmithing: Basics for the Homestead_ says, "as the metal heads up, you will notice a chance in colors from a dull red to a bright red to orange red to yellow red to yellow and finally to white heat" (DeLaRonde 39). If the metal is allowed to become too hot, the metal may burn, rendering it useless.

Drawing out is used to make a rod skinnier and longer. "Drawing out is one of the simplest of the basic techniques, but it is used time and again from the basic projects to the complex" (DeLaRonde 37). It is done by hammering the iron rod out, pushing the hot iron out from under the hammer. Drawing out may be used to create a sharper point, or to make a piece of metal skinnier.

Contrary to drawing out, "Upsetting is compressing a section of a bar to increase its mass in a specific area" ("Fundamentals of Blacksmithing: Upsetting" par. 1). Upsetting requires the iron to be extremely hot, second only to forge welding. Upsetting is often used to create balls or rounded ends to rods ("Techniques and Projects" par. 5).

These simple tools and techniques lay the solid foundation necessary for a beginner in the craft of metallurgy.
