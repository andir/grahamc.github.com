Blacksmithing has long been looked upon by people outside of the craft as a colossal undertaking, requiring great strength to accomplish. Heating, shaping, and cooling metal are all important concepts behind metalworking, and the tools are simply to make those processes possible.

When asked what the most important tools for blacksmithing are, Mr. Mike Hammonds responded with "The anvil (about 85 pounds) and the hammer." (Hammonds) As said in Blacksmithing Basics for the Homestead, "If the forge is the heart of any shop, the anvil and the hammers are the brain, because it is with these that the actual forming and shaping is done." (DeLaRonde 19)

The anvil itself is a critical component in the manipulation process. It offers several facets that are all useful in forging iron. The anvil is important as a solid surface to work on. The shape of the anvil, with a horn, a waste, a table, the hardened face, hard- and pritchet-hole are all utilized in various techniques (McRaven 22).

In order to carefully form and shape metal, hammers of varying styles and weights are used. Three basic styles are available for hammers: the cross-peen (most common), the straight-peen, and the ball-peen, and should weigh around three pounds. Heavier hammers are not necessarily any better than a lighter hammer, and can actually be even less effective if accuracy and control cannot be reliably achieved (DeLaRonde 21).

The forge is simply a contained fireplace, with an air-blast channel (McRaven 13). Forges can range in complexity, some literally made form junk parts, to having all the figurative bells-and-whistles possible. Forges can be fueled by multiple sources, including charcoal, bituminous coal, oil, and gas (Dempsy 34).

A good, solid blacksmith's leg vise, as Mr. Jock Dempsy says, is "almost as important as the anvil, and the most used tool in any shop" and should be as large as possible. In lieu of blacksmith's leg vice, a heavy machinist vice over a hundred pounds will do fine. However anything smaller will be destroyed (Dempsy 35).

Through the combination of simple tools and skill, the possibilities and endless.
