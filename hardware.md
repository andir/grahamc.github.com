As a through-and-through "Maker" I love to experiment and build devices and
trinkets which may not serve any more purpose than a puzzle. Here a few such
projects I've undertaken.

## BigBoard
 - Another PCB design (much simpler than Choreminder)
 - Used three large 7-segment displays
 - Learned assembly and case design techniques
 - [PCB Source](https://github.com/grahamc/bigboard-eagle)
 - [Arduino Source](https://github.com/grahamc/bigboard-arduino)

## ChoreMinder

 - Designed a circuit board using EAGLE
 - Had the board fabricated
 - Sourced components and assembled the board
 - Learned how to communicate over SPI and serial on AVRs without any Ardunio
   libraries
 - [PCB source](https://github.com/grahamc/choreminder-eagle)
 - [Updated code without any Arduino src](https://github.com/grahamc/choreminder-avr)
 - [Original Arduino source](https://github.com/grahamc/choreminder)

KeepWinging is an annual wing-eating competition which involves elaborate data
collection of food consumption. These RFID readers were built to track each
competer's wing eating. Included internally are 32 blue LEDs, an Arduino
microprocessor, and an ID-12 RFID reader.

## Soap Dish

An early print, this soap dish features angled risers, preventing water from
ruining the soap.

## Shaving Dish

This was one of my first and more basic 3D prints, a dish to hold my razor and
replacement blades.

## Headphones Clip

![Headphone Monitor Clip](/resources/hardware/headphone-clip.jpg)

A clip for supporting my headphones behind my monitor. Recently expanded this
clip to hold USB-Micro, USB-Mini, and USB-B cables neatly coiled behind my
monitor.
