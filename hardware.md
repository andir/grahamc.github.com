As a through-and-through "Maker" I love to experiment and build devices and
trinkets which may not serve any more purpose than a puzzle. Here a few such
projects I've undertaken.

## Shaving Dish

This was one of my first and more basic 3D prints, a dish to hold my razor and
replacement blades.

## Soap Dish

An early print, this soap dish features angled risers, preventing water from
ruining the soap.

## Headphones Clip

A clip for supporting my headphones behind my monitor. Recently expanded this
clip to hold USB-Micro, USB-Mini, and USB-B cables neatly coiled behind my
monitor.

## KeepWinging RFID Reader

KeepWinging is an annual wing-eating competition which involves elaborate data
collection of food consumption. These RFID readers were built to track each
competer's wing eating. Included internally are 32 blue LEDs, an Arduino
microprocessor, and an ID-12 RFID reader.
