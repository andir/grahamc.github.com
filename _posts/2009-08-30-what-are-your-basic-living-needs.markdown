title: What Are Your Basic Living Needs?
published: false
---
In my goal to help people who are truly in need, I'd like to explore basic
living needs. I don't mean absolute bare minimums, but necessities to live
respectably. I've compiled a basic list here, but I would love to hear
your suggestions. I'm thinking about the existing institutions in place
that may or may not offer these, and how they can be possibly improved.
Coming up with a solid list is the beginning of my project.
