title: Socialism Doesn't Work, But We Need Something
---
Just recently I was discussing with a good friend of mine, Tyler Lozano,
about a variety of topics ranging from personal dissatisfaction with
personal social lives to the greater dissatisfaction with what is defined
as a normal life. About how he refuses to accept standards of life, like a
house with a white-picket fence, and other amenities that are not necessary,
and he questioned why he deserved so much of what he didn't need? Who
determines who gets luxury while others die?

I, believing in the importance of socialism to an extent (I've long accepted
the failings and never expect nor desire a fully socialist system), made a
suggestion regarding being a philanthropist, and how that entails embracing
socialism internally. He took this, and like the wordsmith he is, rewrote it
in a much more elegant fashion.
