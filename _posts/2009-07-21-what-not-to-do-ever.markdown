### What You Shouldn't <em>Ever</em> Do
#### Even If You're Starving
- Write bad checks, even if you can promise that the money will be there.
- Under-value your services. If you are good, they will pay. If they won't
	pay, chance are they aren't worth it.
- Over-promise on what you can deliver. Do what they want, and later on see
	what you can do to improve their project.
- Under-deliver and let them be disappointed.
- Give unrealistic deadlines. A salesman might say its good for sales, but
	your development team will hate you, and you will lose them.
- Take flat-rate projects. These are screaming feature creep, and they have
	probably have no budget for it.
- Allow feature-creep for free. Feature creep is a natural part of a project.
	Clients don't know everything that they want, and will refine and expand
	the project as it goes. This is ok, but not if they don't pay for it.
- Let the client strangle you. If they can't be pleased and won't pay, make
	sure your company can survive to finish the project. Be willing to drop
	a client that is strangling your company, its not worth it.
- Let a good idea keep you from getting anything done. Just because something
	might be better long-term, doesn't mean now is a good time to do it.

### What You *Should* Do
#### Especially If You're Starving
- Keep open conversations with your clients to make sure they're happy. An
	unhappy client makes everything harder, try to keep communication open to
	understand their needs and desires, and to make sure that minor things
	aren't becoming major.

Of course, the "Do" list is short because "boss" didn't make very many good
decisions in my opinion.
