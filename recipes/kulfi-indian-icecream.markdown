title: Kulfi (Indian Ice-Cream)
---
### Ingredients
- 1 12 oz can of evaporated milk
- 3.5 oz of black, Red-Label loose leaf tea
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1 14oz can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 cup heavy cream
- Handful of finely chopped pistachios, plus extra for garnish

### Directions
In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring evaporated milk to a simmer until
small bubbles form around the circumference of the pot. Meanwhile, add the
black tea to the evaporated milk and whisk in the cardamom. Once the milk is
simmering, turn the heat off, cover and let sit and steep for 30 minutes.

Strain the evaporated milk into a large bowl. Whisk in the condensed milk,
heavy cream and pistachios. Pour the mixture small or large bowls. Cover the
bowls with a piece of plastic wrap to avoid freezer burn and the formation of
"skin." Pop them into the freezer overnight.

Garnish with more nuts and serve.
