### Ingredients
- 6 - 9 Medium Tomatoes
- 2 - 3 Jalape単os
- 1/2 Large Yellow Onion
- 1 Garlic Clove
- Salt
- Black Pepper
- Cilantro
- One lime

### Directions
1. Cut the top out of the tomato.
2. Cut the skin of the tomato all the way around. Do this twice, meeting like an X on the top and the bottom.
3. Place the tomatoes and jalape単os on a baking sheet, and broil until the skin starts to brown. This usually takes about 30 minutes. More brown == more delicious.
4. Dice the garlic and add it to a medium bowl.
5. Dice the onion into tiny bits and add it to the bowl.
6. Peel the tomatoes and mash them in the bowl. Make sure the tough middle bit is removed, and there are no large tomato parts left.
7. Dice the jalape単os and add it to the bowl.
8. Add 1/3 of the lime's juice.
9. Add salt, pepper, and cilantro.

#### Notes
If you have a molcajete, grind the garlic and jalape単os in it, then just mash everything into that. It's delicious.
